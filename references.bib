abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a vast interest in optimal usage of computing resources so that massive data can be processed with minimal cost. The need to use a pool of shared resources in a wide area network that provide elasticity, high capacity of computation and ability to store information on location-independent storages have led to the advent of cloud-computing. However, the global nature of cloud brings about some challenges in security domain when physical control over our information in cloud is impossible. Thus, encrypting critical data becomes essential, and strongly advisable. The server-side encryption in an untrustworthy environment like public cloud is too risky. On the other hand, client-side encryption can undermine the benefits of cloud since it is a time-consuming task for encryption and decryption. To address this issue, we developed a private cloud as an intermediary. In this paper, based on XaaS concept, we design an Encryption as a Service in order to get rid of the security risks of cloud provider's encryption and the inefficiency of client-side encryption.}

abstract="The Automatic Certificate Management Environment protocol (ACME) has significantly contributed to the widespread use of digital certificates in safeguarding the authenticity and privacy of Internet data. These certificates are required for implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. However, it is well known that the cryptographic algorithms employed in these certificates will become insecure with the emergence of quantum computers. This study assesses the challenges in transitioning ACME to the post-quantum landscape using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). To evaluate the cost of ACME's PQC migration, we create a simulation environment for issuing PQC-only and hybrid digital certificates. Our experiments reveal performance drawbacks associated with the switch to PQC or hybrid solutions. However, considering the high volume of certificates issued daily by organizations like Let's Encrypt, the performance of ACME is of utmost importance. To address this concern, we propose a novel challenge method for ACME. Compared to the widely used HTTP-01 method, our findings indicate an average PQC certificate issuance time that is 4.22 times faster, along with a potential reduction of up to 35{\%} in communication size.",

abstract="Traditionally, the most data-heavy part of a (D)TLS handshake has been authentication which includes a handshake signature and digital certificates. Although most common (D)TLS usecases are not significantly affected, some constrained ones such as low bandwidth environments or delay sensitive applications can see drastic performance degradation due to big certificates or certificate chains. That has led the security community to seek options to alleviate the issue. Post-quantum signatures and keys, on the other hand, have been proven to noticeably slow down handshakes even for common Internet (D)TLS or QUIC applications due to the significantly higher amounts of post-quantum authentication data they include. In this work, we quantify the size issue of post-quantum certificates in (D)TLS and QUIC and make the case for speeding up (D)TLS and QUIC handshakes by omitting the intermediate certificate authority certificates in the handshake. We present how that can be achieved along with the usecases that will mostly benefit from such a mechanism. We offer quantitative analyses to show that this approach is relatively straightforward, backwards compatible and with little overhead introduced for caching the certificates. We also discuss caching mechanisms based on different optimization goals.",

abstract = {Large-scale quantum computers will be able to efficiently solve the underlying mathematical problems of widely deployed public key cryptosystems in the near future. This threat has sparked increased interest in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and standardization bodies like NIST, IETF, and ETSI are in the process of standardizing PQC schemes as a new generation of cryptography. This raises the question of how to ensure a fast, reliable, and secure transition to upcoming PQC standards in today's highly interconnected world.In this work, we propose and investigate a migration strategy towards post-quantum (PQ) authentication for the network protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS). Our strategy is based on the concept of "mixed certificate chains" that use different signature algorithms within the same certificate chain. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our migration strategy, we combine the well-studied and trusted hash-based signature schemes SPHINCS+ and XMSS with elliptic curve cryptography first and subsequently with lattice-based PQC signature schemes (CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon). Furthermore, we combine authentication based on mixed certificate chains with the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) CRYSTALS-Kyber as representative for PQC KEMs to evaluate a fully post-quantum and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3 handshake.Our results show that mixed certificate chains containing hash-based signature schemes only at the root certificate authority level lead to feasible connection establishment times despite the increase in communication size. By analyzing code size and peak memory usage of our client and server programs we further demonstrate the suitability of our migration strategy even for embedded devices.},

Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate. As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms. This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance. The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.},

SPHINCS+ has significant advantages over the state of the art in terms of speed, signature size, and security, and is among the nine remaining signature schemes in the second round of the NIST PQC standardization project. One of our main contributions in this context is a new few-time signature scheme that we call FORS. Our second main contribution is the introduction of tweakable hash functions and a demonstration how they allow for a unified security analysis of hash-based signature schemes. We give a security reduction for SPHINCS+ using this abstraction and derive secure parameters in accordance with the resulting bound. Finally, we present speed results for our optimized implementation of SPHINCS+ and compare to SPHINCS-256, Gravity-SPHINCS, and Picnic.},

abstract={Most lattice-based cryptographic schemes are built upon the assumed hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves bridge arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.},
